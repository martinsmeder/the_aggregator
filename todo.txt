========================== GENERAL PLAN: ===============================

1. Fetch and Store Data:
Learn how to work with arrays, functions, and asynchronous programming, 
which will help you fetch and process data from both RSS feeds and APIs,
and store it in Firestore.

2. App-Logic with Categorization and Search:
Dive into objects, which will help you organize the data and implement 
features like categorization and search functionality. No need for an UI 
yet. 

3. UI with React:
Once you have the app-logic in place, learn React to build the frontend UI, 
taking advantage of its component-based structure and state management.

========================== DETAILED PLAN: ===============================

GOAL: MAKE INTERESTING INFORMATION ACCESSIBLE EASILY IN ONE PLACE

Remember to use test database when testing!
1. Render 10 items 
2. Render 10 more items while keeping the first 10 items rendered
3. So on and so forth 
4. Categorization

Things to do:
* Get react and vite into this project 
* Logic for loading x amount of extra items, and add to state 
* Think about platonic ideal app 
* Figure out the amount of AI resources that are available for free (most likely
  summarization), and how to best implement it in my app
* Establish first principles (budget, goal/ideal, time, resources, etc)
* Create a plan that is grounded in first principles and that leads to the best 
  possible solution with the freely available resources
